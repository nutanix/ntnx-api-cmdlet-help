# Get-Metric

## SYNOPSIS
Displays a metric of the cluster for given time period.

## SYNTAX

### Server (Default)
```
Get-Metric [-ClusterName] <String> [-Metrics] <String> -StartTimeSecsAgo <Int64> -EndTimeSecsAgo <Int64>
 -IntervalInSecs <Int32> [-Servers <System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1[System.String]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Alt1
```
Get-Metric [-ClusterUuid] <String> [-Metrics] <String> -StartTimeSecsAgo <Int64> -EndTimeSecsAgo <Int64>
 -IntervalInSecs <Int32> [-Servers <System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1[System.String]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Alt3
```
Get-Metric [-ClusterUuid] <String> [-Metrics] <String> -IntervalInSecs <Int32>
 [-Servers <System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1[System.String]>] [<CommonParameters>]

```

## DESCRIPTION
Displays a metric of the cluster for given time period. To list all available metrics, try `Get-Help Get-Metric -Parameter Metrics`

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\>  Get-Metric -Server 10.46.28.31 -ClusterName mycluster -Metrics controller_num_iops -StartTimeSecsAgo 600 -EndTimeSecsAgo 0 -IntervalInSecs 60
```

Displays the metric controller_num_iops from 600 seconds ago till now with 60 seconds of interval from the cluster. To get cluster name use `Get-Cluster` command.

### Example 2
```powershell
PS C:\>  Get-Help Get-Metric -Parameter Metrics
```

Displays all available metrics names
